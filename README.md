## Excercise 1 - User privileges ![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-queries-yellow.svg)

Five users need to be created for the following roles:

| Role | Privileges | 
|---|---|
| **Inventory**  | Maintains the two tables `products` and `productlines`.  | 
| **Bookkeeping**  | Makes sure that all orders are paid.  | 
| **Human resources**  | Takes care of employees and their offices.  | 
| **Sales**  | Creates the orders for the customers.  | 
| **IT**  | Maintains this database.  | 

<br/>

<a name="argumentation"></a>
### Granted privileges argumentation

- `inventory` - This user is granted *SELECT, INSERT,* and *UPDATE* permissions to both `products` and `productlines` tables. The reason for that is due to the responsibilities that this role is associated with, viz. to maintain the data about Products and Product Lines.
- `bookKeeping` - User ‚Ññ 2 is restricted to only perform *SELECT* operations to the `orders` table since they only need to monitor the Orders. 
- `hr` - The user representing *Human resources* is allowed to execute *SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE* and *DELETE* operations on the database, so that they can fetch, update or delete the data in the `employees` table. As well as *SELECT* the records for all their Offices.
- `sales` - This user is just given *INSERT* permissions to `orders` and `orderdetails`, since user named `bookKeeping` will review the Orders. Additionally, it can *SELECT* from the `customers` table.
- `it` - Maintaining the database would require full access to the entire database, therefore, any operation is permitted.

### Queries
> Create users
```sql
CREATE USER 'inventory' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON classicmodels.products TO 'inventory'@'%';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON classicmodels.productlines TO 'inventory'@'%';
```

```sql
CREATE USER 'bookKeeping' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
GRANT SELECT ON classicmodels.orders TO 'bookKeeping'@'%';
```

```sql
CREATE USER 'hr' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON classicmodels.employees TO 'hr'@'%';
GRANT SELECT ON classicmodels.offices TO 'hr'@'%';
```

```sql
CREATE USER 'sales' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
GRANT INSERT ON classicmodels.orders TO 'sales'@'%';
GRANT INSERT ON classicmodels.orderdetails TO 'sales'@'%';
GRANT SELECT ON classicmodels.customers TO 'sales'@'%';
```

```sql
CREATE USER 'it' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
GRANT ALL ON classicmodels.* TO 'it'@'%';
```
<br/>

*‚ùóÔ∏èYou can also add the following line before each user creation to make sure privileges are not compiled together with your previous implementation.* üòâ *(Make sure to change the username after `EXISTS` for the respective user.)*

```sql
DROP USER IF EXISTS 'inventory';
```

## Excercise 2 - Logging ![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/log-files-blue.svg)

A segment from the database log file is included next to demonstrate the following elements:

* The users and their privileges being added (ref. Exercise 1)
* Three changes to the database:
  * Insert 2 new Employees 
  * Insert 1 new Product
  * Create 1 new Order
* One attempt to make a change by a user with the wrong privileges

</br>

*‚ùóÔ∏èThe required elements are being highlighted (ùóï)*
